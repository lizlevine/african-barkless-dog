    <h1>Basenji: The African Barkless Dog</h1>
    <h2>From Fearless Lion Hunter to Fastidious Urban Pampered Pet</h2>

    <p>
      The Basenji is a breed of hunting dog. It was bred from stock that
      originated in central Africa. Most of the major kennel clubs in the
      English-speaking world place the breed in the hound group—more
      specifically, in the sighthound type. The Fédération Cynologique
      Internationale places the breed in its group five (spitz and primitive
      types), and the United Kennel Club (US) places the breed in its Sighthound
      and pariah group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Basenji produces an unusual yodel-like sound (commonly called a
      "baroo"), due to its unusually shaped larynx. This trait also gives the
      Basenji the nickname "barkless dog".
    </p>
    <p>
      Basenjis share many unique traits with pariah dog types. Basenjis, like
      dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs and some other breeds of dog, come into
      estrus only once annually as compared to other dog breeds, which may have
      two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingoes and Basenji lack a
      distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations
      over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds.
